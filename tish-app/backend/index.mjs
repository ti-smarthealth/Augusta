 *   the row exists. §3.1 chose 404 for that reason and 3.2 followed it.
 * - `REMINDER_NOT_FOUND` — same reasoning, from 1.14.
 * - `PROFILE_NOT_FOUND` — a Cognito user with no RDS row is **authenticated**;
 *   the profile simply is not built yet. 401 would invite the client to sign
 *   them out, which is the opposite of the intended recovery. It is a separate
 *   code from `USER_NOT_FOUND` for exactly this reason: that one means *the
 *   person you asked about* does not exist, and the two want different copy and
 *   different client behaviour.
 *
 * Pairing each code with its status in one table is what stops a future edit
