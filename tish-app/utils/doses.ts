 *
 * **Local time on both sides is what makes this work at all.** `scheduled_for`
 * is an absolute instant, so parsing it and formatting in the device's own zone
 * gives the wall-clock the patient sees. It matches only while the device agrees
 * with `APP_TIMEZONE` — see §0.6, which records that the server's zone is a
