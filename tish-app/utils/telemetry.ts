/**
 * TELEMETRY.md §3 — the product-analytics half, and the part that touches
 * storage and the network.
 *
 * The rules live in `telemetry-policy.ts`, which has no imports and is unit
 * tested. This file is deliberately thin: a buffer, a batched POST, and the
 * serialisation that keeps the two from racing.
 *
 * **Two contracts hold everywhere below, and nothing here is worth breaking
 * either for.** Product analytics is the least important thing this app does —
 * it sits in the same process as an alarm that tells someone to take their
 * medication.
 *
 * 1. **Never throws.** Every entry point swallows its own failures. A telemetry
 *    write that rejects would surface as an unhandled rejection on the launch
 *    path, and callers are not written to catch one.
 * 2. **Never awaited by the UI.** Callers fire and forget. Nothing on screen
 *    waits for a buffer write or a POST.
 *
 * There is no SDK and there will not be one: §3 rejects device→Firehose
 * directly (it needs a Cognito *Identity* Pool this project does not have, and
 * it would let any device write arbitrary records to the stream), so the
 * transport is ours and it is this.
