 * Called when a scheduled notification actually fires. Rewrites this slot's

 *
 * **5.6 changed what this is for, and it is worth being precise about.** Before
 * the horizon existed, exactly one occurrence was ever scheduled, so this was
 * the *only* thing keeping a reminder alive — the chain-forward. Now the sync
 * writes `horizonDays` occurrences at once and this becomes a top-up: it
 * re-establishes the same depth measured from the next occurrence, which is the
 * same convention the sync uses. §0.3 asked for a decision between "no-op" and
 * "top-up"; a no-op would let the horizon shrink by a day per dose until the app
 * was next opened, which is the failure 5.6 exists to remove.
 *
 * **Rewriting the whole horizon rather than appending one day is deliberate.**
 * Appending is cheaper and wrong in the case that matters: if the app has not
 * run for several days, the occurrences that fired in the meantime are gone and
 * appending a single far-end day leaves the gap in the middle. Rewriting is
 * idempotent — the identifiers are date-keyed, so an occurrence that is already
 * scheduled is replaced by an identical alert — so it repairs the gap instead.
 *
 * **Reschedules the whole burst, not the one alert that fired** (4.7b). The
 * alternative — each member chaining only itself — would quietly shrink the
 * burst to one the first time a response cancelled the remainder, which is every
 * time the patient is awake. So the burst is rebuilt from `burstCount`.
 *
 * **The cancel-then-reschedule ordering has stopped being load-bearing, and it
 * is worth saying so rather than leaving a stale invariant in place.** §0.6
 * records that rescheduling first used to drag today's un-fired alerts into
 * tomorrow, because a burst member's identifier was the same string on both
 * days. It cannot now: this rewrite only ever writes occurrences from tomorrow
 * on, and the cancel is scoped to the day that fired, so the two touch disjoint
 * identifiers. `_layout.tsx` still sequences them, for one narrow reason — a
 * payload from **before** 5.6 carries no occurrence key, so its cancel is still
 * reminder-and-slot-wide and would eat a horizon written first. Reversing the
 * order gains nothing, so the sequencing stays.
 *
 * A payload from before 5.6 also carries no `horizonDays` and reads as 1 —
 * exactly the single next occurrence that build chained forward. Such an alarm
 * therefore collapses its slot's horizon to one day until the next
 * reconciliation, which is imminent by construction: the app is running, because
 * the listener that called this only fires when it is.

 * `dismissNotificationAsync`. Neither call reaches the other queue.
 *
 * **`timeStr` is not optional in practice, and leaving it out was a live bug.**
 * A twice-daily reminder holds a pending alert for each slot. Cancelling
 * reminder-wide when the 08:00 alarm fires cancels the pending 20:00 alert too,
 * and `rescheduleNextOccurrence` afterwards only rewrites the slot that fired —
 * so the evening dose stopped alarming every single morning, and was repaired

 * caught this because the ordering was right; the *scope* was not.

 * can fire in the middle of this running. Each removal is caught individually so
 * one failure cannot abandon the rest — a half-cancelled burst is the failure
 * this exists to prevent.
 *
 * Cold start works unchanged: tapping alert 2 of 5 launches the app, the
 * response listener runs, and both queues are read fresh from the OS rather than
 * from any state the app was holding.
 *
 * **`occurrenceKey` is the 5.6 counterpart of `timeStr`, and leaving it out
 * would be the same bug one dimension over.** Once the horizon is several days
 * deep, this slot holds a pending burst for each of the next `daysAhead` days. A
 * cancel scoped only to the reminder and slot would take all of them, and the
 * top-up afterwards rewrites the horizon from the *next* occurrence — so the
 * alarm the patient just answered would silently cost them nothing today and
 * everything for the rest of the week is rebuilt anyway. Passing the key from
 * the firing alert's own payload keeps the cancel inside the day that fired.
 * Callers with no key (a payload from before 5.6) get the old reminder+slot
 * behaviour, which is what those alarms always meant.
 *
 * **Callers that respond to an alarm already on screen want
 * `dismissPresentedAlarms` instead** — see the note there. This one is for the

/**
 * The tray half of 4.7c on its own: clear alerts that have already fired,
 * without touching anything still scheduled.
 *
 * **This is what a response from the overlay must use, and the reason is a
 * consequence of §0.6's identifier-reuse finding rather than a preference.** By
 * the time the patient presses a button, `_layout.tsx` has already cancelled
 * today's remaining burst and chained the slot forward — so the identifiers that
 * *used* to be the rest of today's burst now hold **tomorrow's** alarm. A
 * scheduled-queue cancel at that point deletes the next occurrence, and only the
 * next launch re-sync puts it back. There is also nothing left for it to find:
 * the alerts it was written to stop were replaced, not left pending.
 *
 * What is genuinely still there is the tray — every burst member that fired
 * before the patient reached the phone — and that is what this clears.
 *
 * **Deliberately not occurrence-scoped, unlike the scheduled-queue cancel.** The
 * tray only ever holds alerts that have already fired, so there is no future to
 * protect; and a slot whose alarm is being answered may well have yesterday's
 * unanswered copy sitting there too, which should go with it.

 * and sound because the payload carries them, and it does *not* know

 * alerts into a queue 5.6 is already trying to fit under 64.
 *
 * The identifier is deliberately outside the burst series (`snoozeIdentifierFor`)
 * so this cannot land on top of tomorrow's alarm, and inside the reminder+slot
 * namespace so a reminder edit, a delete, or the next occurrence firing all
 * still clear an unanswered snooze.
 *
 * Falls back to the default sound rather than silence if the payload carried no
 * sound key: a snooze that re-arms inaudibly is worse than one that re-arms with
