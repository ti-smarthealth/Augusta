/**
 * 6.2 — the client half of the error contract.
 *
 * The server (6.1) answers a failure with `{ error, code, problems? }`. `error`
 * is developer-facing English; `code` is the stable identifier this module
 * turns into a locale key. Every message the app used to build by showing
 * `data.error` straight from the response now comes through here, because the
 * app ships en and zh-Hant and a server-authored sentence is only ever one of
 * them.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free so `node --test` can exercise it, like
 * `relationship-types.ts`, `doses.ts` and `date.ts` before it — and `t` is
 * injected rather than imported for the same reason.
 *
 * **The fallback is the part that needed a decision rather than a default**, and
 * it is the reason this returns keys for every input rather than `null` for an
 * unrecognised one. A code this build has never heard of is not an edge case: it
 * is *guaranteed* on the next backend deploy after any client build, permanently
 * and by design, because the two ship independently — build 8 is in TestFlight
 * and a client change needs a new build. So an unknown code must still produce a
 * real sentence. It degrades down a ladder:
 *
 *   1. recognised `problems[]` codes — the specific, per-field sentences;
 *   2. a recognised `code`;
 *   3. **the HTTP status**, which the client always has even when it has never
 *      heard of the code;
 *   4. `errors.network`, for a request that never got a status at all.
 *
 * Rung 3 is what makes rung 2 safe to miss. It is keyed on the status and never
 * on the code, which is also what keeps the `/me` decision intact: a 404 from an
 * unmapped future code says "we couldn't find that", never "your session
 * ended", so nothing here can talk a client into signing a half-registered user
 * out. §0.6 records why that matters.

 * exist — a bug in this app, not a thing a patient did — and inventing patient-
 * facing copy for them would be writing sentences nobody should ever see. The
