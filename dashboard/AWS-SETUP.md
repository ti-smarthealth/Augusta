# Tish Admin Dashboard — AWS setup

**Status: provisioned and live.** This was a
step-by-step runbook to be worked through by hand; everything in it has now
been done, so it is a record of what exists and how to change it. Account
`180891490019`. Provisioned 2026-08-08.

**Live URL: <https://admin.ti-smarthealth.com>**

## The GitHub token

**⚠ BROKEN since 2026-08-25, when the repository moved to the `ti-smarthealth`
organization.** The installed token was a fine-grained PAT whose resource owner
was the `mcha291` personal account, and a fine-grained PAT only ever grants
repos belonging to its resource owner — so the transfer severed it. Until a
replacement is installed, the localization editor fails as described below
(generic 500 in the UI, `401`/`404` against api.github.com in CloudWatch).

To install a replacement (also the rotation procedure — the old token's expiry
has the same symptom):

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained personal access tokens
   → **Generate new token**.
2. **Resource owner: `ti-smarthealth`** — this is the step the transfer
   changed; a token owned by the personal account can no longer see the repo.
   If the org is not offered in the dropdown, allow fine-grained PATs at
   Organization settings → Third-party Access → Personal access tokens.
3. Repository access: **only** `ti-smarthealth/Augusta`.
4. Permissions: **Contents → Read and write**. Nothing else.
5. Install it (the token never reaches the browser; it lives only in the Lambda):

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration --region ap-east-2 --function-name tish-admin-translations --environment "Variables={GITHUB_REPO=ti-smarthealth/Augusta,GITHUB_LOCALES_DIR=tish-app/locales,ALLOWED_ORIGIN=https://admin.ti-smarthealth.com,GITHUB_TOKEN=$NEW_PAT}"
```

Note `GITHUB_REPO` moves to the new owner in the same command — the Lambda
builds its API paths from it, so either half alone leaves the editor broken.

Note the function name: the token goes on `tish-admin-translations`, **not**
`tish-admin-api` — see the split below. `update-function-configuration`
**replaces** the whole environment map, so every variable has to be in that one
call. Set `NEW_PAT` in your shell first so the token stays out of your history.

## Accounts: staff sign themselves up, you approve

Self-registration is open at **<https://admin.ti-smarthealth.com/signup>**,
reachable from "Create an account" on the landing screen. Signing up gets
someone an account; it does **not** get them data.

> Cognito's hosted login carries its own "Need an account? Sign up" link, which
> appeared as soon as self-signup was enabled on the pool. It works and the
> domain trigger still guards it, but it collects only email and password — not
> the name or mobile number. That is why the app shows a landing screen rather
> than redirecting straight to the hosted login: the redirect made the form
> above unreachable unless you knew to type `/signup`.

1. Staff fill in name, work email, optional mobile, password.
2. A Pre Sign-up Lambda rejects anything that isn't `@ti-smarthealth.com`.
3. Cognito emails a six-digit code; entering it confirms the address.
4. They land on "waiting for approval" and stay there until you act.
5. **You approve** by adding them to the `approved` group — Cognito console →
   User pools → `tish-admin` → Users → pick the user → Group memberships →
   Add. Or:

```bash
aws cognito-idp admin-add-user-to-group --region ap-east-2 --user-pool-id ap-east-2_RkCillRxC --username someone@ti-smarthealth.com --group-name approved
```

**Membership of `approved` is the authorization.** The admin API checks it on
every request and returns 403 without it, so an unapproved account can sign in
and see nothing. Removing someone from the group revokes access within the ID
token's lifetime — up to an hour, not immediately.

The check is enforced server-side in `server/index.mjs`; the dashboard reads the
same `cognito:groups` claim only to decide whether to show the waiting screen
instead of firing requests that would all 403.

> Approval reaches a session at sign-in. Someone approved while signed in has to
> sign out and back in — the waiting screen says so.

Your own account (`admin@ti-smarthealth.com`) was created before self-signup
existed and is already in `approved`.

MFA (authenticator app) is **enabled but optional**. To make it mandatory:

```bash
aws cognito-idp set-user-pool-mfa-config --region ap-east-2 --user-pool-id ap-east-2_RkCillRxC --software-token-mfa-configuration Enabled=true --mfa-configuration ON
```

### Changing who may register

The domain rule lives in the Lambda's `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` env var
(comma-separated), so widening it needs no code change:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration --region ap-east-2 --function-name tish-admin-presignup --environment "Variables={ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS=ti-smarthealth.com,partner.example}"
```

Admin-created users bypass the rule deliberately — otherwise a bad value here
would lock you out of your own escape hatch.

## Email comes from ti-smarthealth.com

The pool is on `EmailSendingAccount: DEVELOPER`, sending as
**`Tish Admin <donotreply@ti-smarthealth.com>`** through the SES domain identity
in **ap-northeast-2 (Seoul)** — DKIM verified, SPF already in the apex record.
Taipei has no SES endpoint and Seoul is its designated alternate.

This works despite SES still being **in the sandbox**, and that is the reason
sign-up is restricted to the company domain. Sandbox rules allow sending only to
verified identities — and the verified identity is the *domain*, so any
`@ti-smarthealth.com` recipient is fine while `someone@gmail.com` is not. A
gmail signup would be accepted by Cognito and then never receive its code, so
the trigger rejects it up front with an explanation instead.

**Once SES production access is granted** (still `ProductionAccessEnabled:
false` as of 2026-08-08, filed per MIGRATION.md A0), external addresses become
deliverable and `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` can be widened. Nothing else changes.

> **This applies to the staff dashboard only.** The *app* pool

Any address at the verified domain is a valid `From` — a domain identity does
not need each mailbox verified separately, and `donotreply@` need not exist as a
real inbox to send from. Replies to it will bounce, which is the intent.

The SES sending authorization policy `CognitoTaipei` on the identity now lists
**both** pools — the app's and this one. It trusts the regional principal
`cognito-idp.ap-east-2.amazonaws.com`; the global one fails silently.

### Bounce and complaint tracking

Configuration set **`tish-transactional`** (ap-northeast-2), set as the
identity's *default* — so anything sending as `ti-smarthealth.com` picks it up
without having to name it, including the app pool whenever it moves off
`COGNITO_DEFAULT`. Two destinations:

| Destination | Events | Goes to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sns-alerts` | Bounce, Complaint, Delivery, Reject, RenderingFailure | SNS `tish-ses-events` |
| `cloudwatch-metrics` | the above plus Send | CloudWatch metrics |

Reputation metrics are enabled on the set, so bounce and complaint rates are
graphable per configuration set rather than only account-wide.

`compliance@ti-smarthealth.com` is subscribed to the topic — deliberately not
`admin@`, so deliverability alerts stay separate from the dashboard's own
account. **The subscription is not live until someone opens the AWS
confirmation email and clicks the link**; until then events publish and nobody
is told. Check with:

```bash
aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --region ap-northeast-2 --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:ap-northeast-2:180891490019:tish-ses-events --query 'Subscriptions[].{To:Endpoint,Arn:SubscriptionArn}' --output table
```

A `SubscriptionArn` of `PendingConfirmation` means it has not been clicked yet.
To add another recipient:

```bash
aws sns subscribe --region ap-northeast-2 --topic-arn arn:aws:sns:ap-northeast-2:180891490019:tish-ses-events --protocol email --notification-endpoint someone@ti-smarthealth.com
```

This matters beyond hygiene: SES suspends sending above roughly 5% bounce or
0.1% complaint, and the account-level suppression list already silently drops
addresses that hard-bounce. Without these destinations a bounce was invisible
until someone thought to look at the reputation dashboard.

## SMS verification: wired, but blocked upstream

Everything on the AWS side is in place — the pool has an `SmsConfiguration`
pointing at `CognitoIdpSNSServiceRole-tish-admin` (its own `ExternalId`, not
shared with the app pool's role), and the sign-up form already collects a
mobile number in E.164.

**It is not switched on, because SNS in ap-east-2 is still in the sandbox.**
Two verified numbers exist (`+886905115797` and one AU number); SMS to anyone
else is silently dropped. The monthly spend cap is also still the `$1` default.

To turn it on once SNS production access lands and the cap is raised — add
`phone_number` to the auto-verified attributes:

```bash
aws cognito-idp update-user-pool --region ap-east-2 --user-pool-id ap-east-2_RkCillRxC --auto-verified-attributes email phone_number
```

⚠ `update-user-pool` **replaces** every setting it accepts, so a bare call like
that resets the email config, the Lambda trigger and the password policy. Build
the payload from a live `describe-user-pool` first — the same footgun
MIGRATION.md flags for the app pool.

## What exists

| DNS | `admin` CNAME in Route 53 zone `Z0492003C3ORSSH0BIWC`, written by Amplify | global |

`tish-admin-api` shares the app backend's VPC placement — subnets
`subnet-0ef1ccc6d175653c3`, `subnet-05a4cca510c84174d`, `subnet-02d53fa57a84c5a23`
and security group `sg-04bc9817aedc7ba73` (`tish-lambda-sg`), which is what
`tish-rds-sg` accepts 5432 from. `season1` is private, so that group membership
is the only route to it.

### Why the API is two Lambdas

**A VPC-attached Lambda here has no route to the internet.** The subnets send
`0.0.0.0/0` to an Internet Gateway, there is no NAT gateway and no VPC
endpoints, and Lambda ENIs never get public IPs — so a request to
`api.github.com` from inside the VPC hangs until the function times out. This
was measured, not assumed: the same `/translations` call takes **14s** (timeout)
on the VPC function and **3s** (a clean `401 Bad credentials`) outside it.

So the routes are split by what they need to reach:

| Function | VPC | Reaches | Serves | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tish-admin-api` | yes | private RDS | `/tables`, `/tables/{name}` | `DB_*` |
| `tish-admin-translations` | no | api.github.com | `/translations` | `GITHUB_*` |

**One zip, deployed twice.** They run identical code from `server/index.mjs`;
only VPC config and env differ. `requiredEnvFor()` makes the env requirements
per-route, so neither function carries a credential it cannot use — the
translations function has no `DB_PASSWORD` and the table function has no
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. Each fails closed with a 500 on the other's routes, which API
Gateway never sends it anyway.

The alternatives were a NAT gateway (~$30–45/month) or interface endpoints
(~$7/month per AZ, and you have three) — both paying monthly to restore
connectivity that a function outside the VPC has for nothing.

**This is the pattern to follow for the planned telemetry work.** Athena and S3
are "the internet" from inside that VPC too, so query routes belong on
`tish-admin-translations` (or a sibling outside the VPC), not on
`tish-admin-api`. Do that and the telemetry path needs no VPC endpoints and no
NAT at all. Athena, Glue, Kinesis, Firehose, Timestream and OpenSearch are all
available in ap-east-2 — verified 2026-08-08. QuickSight is **not**, which is
academic given the dashboard is custom-built.

### Two things are not in Taipei, and can't be

`ap-east-2` has **no API Gateway HTTP APIs** and **no Amplify Hosting**. Both
were assumed by the original plan and neither is available:

- **The gateway is a REST API, not an HTTP API.** This is not cosmetic — REST
  sends Lambda proxy payload format **1.0** (`httpMethod`, `path`) where HTTP
  APIs send **2.0** (`requestContext.http.method`, `rawPath`). The handler reads
  both; see `eventMethod`/`eventPath` in `server/index.mjs`. Consequences: the
  stage name is in the URL (`/prod`), and CORS preflight is a MOCK integration
  per resource rather than one API-level CORS block.

  > **⚠ Adding a route is two places, and forgetting the second one fails in a
  > way that does not look like a routing problem.** There is no `{proxy+}`
  > here: every path is an explicit resource. A route added to
  > `server/index.mjs` and deployed still has no resource, so the gateway
  > answers before the Lambda is ever reached — and because the 403 carries no
  > CORS headers, the browser reports it as **`Failed to fetch`**, which reads
  > like the API is down rather than like a path that was never created. This
  > cost a round of debugging on `GET /crashes` (2026-08-28).
  >
  > Each new path needs, on `0u10zqz4r0`: a resource; the method with
  > `--authorization-type COGNITO_USER_POOLS --authorizer-id ws0bsp` and an
  > `AWS_PROXY` integration to `tish-admin-api`; an `OPTIONS` method with a
  > MOCK integration returning the four CORS headers (copy them from
  > `/daily-opens` — the allowed origin is the custom domain only); and a
  > deployment to stage `prod`. The blanket `apigateway-admin-invoke`
  > permission on the Lambda already covers `0u10zqz4r0/*/*`, so no new Lambda
  > permission is needed. **Allow ~30 seconds after deploying** before testing:
  > the first preflight can still 403 while the stage propagates, which looks
  > exactly like the mistake you just fixed.
- **Amplify Hosting is in ap-northeast-2 (Seoul).** Only the build and control
  plane live there; the assets are served from CloudFront either way, so Taiwan
  users are not taking a Seoul round-trip. Seoul was chosen because the account's
  other Amplify app and the SES identity are already there.

The API and Lambda *are* in Taipei, next to RDS, so no request touches two
regions.

## The custom domain

`admin.ti-smarthealth.com` is an Amplify domain association on branch `main`.
Because the Route 53 zone is in the same account, Amplify requested the ACM
certificate and wrote both the validation record and the `admin` CNAME itself —
nothing was created by hand, and renewal is automatic. This is the one job
Amplify does that S3 + CloudFront would have meant doing manually, including an
ACM certificate pinned to us-east-1.

**It is the single canonical origin.** `main.d1x8yq4r6ivp8n.amplifyapp.com`
still serves the page — it is the same branch — but API calls from it are now
CORS-blocked, because the gateway's preflight is a MOCK integration that can
return exactly one origin. Supporting both would mean either echoing back
whatever `Origin` the browser sent, which permits any site, or moving preflight
onto the Lambda and paying an invocation per request. Neither is worth it for a
second URL nobody needs to use.

No rebuild was needed to switch. The SPA derives its OAuth `redirect_uri` from
`window.location.origin` ([src/lib/auth.ts](src/lib/auth.ts)), so it follows
whatever host it is served from; only Cognito's registered callback list and the
CORS origin are host-specific. Rolling back is those two things in reverse.

## CORS, and why local dev uses mock mode

`ALLOWED_ORIGIN` is a single origin (the Amplify URL) — the handler echoes
exactly one value, and the preflight MOCK integrations are hard-coded to the
same one. So `npm run dev` on `http://localhost:5173` **cannot** call the real
API; the browser blocks the response. That is what `VITE_MOCK=1` in
`.env.local` is for.

`http://localhost:5173` is registered as a Cognito callback URL, so a real
*login* works locally — it's only the API calls that are blocked. To develop
against real data, point `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` at localhost temporarily and change
the three preflight integration responses to match, then put them back.

## Deploys

All three deployables ship from GitHub Actions on push to `main`, using one
OIDC role (`github-lambda-deploy`) — no AWS keys in GitHub. See
`tish-app/backend/DEPLOY.md`.

| Change under | Workflow | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dashboard/server/**` | `deploy-admin-api.yml` | Lambdas `tish-admin-api` **and** `tish-admin-translations` (same zip) |
| `dashboard/cognito-triggers/**` | `deploy-cognito-triggers.yml` | Lambda `tish-admin-presignup` |
| `dashboard/**` (excl. `server/`) | `deploy-dashboard.yml` | Amplify `d1x8yq4r6ivp8n` |
| `tish-app/backend/**` | `deploy-backend.yml` | Lambda `operation-strix` |

The Amplify app is deliberately **not** connected to the GitHub repo. Connecting
it requires an interactive OAuth authorization in the console and monorepo-root
plumbing; deploying from Actions reuses the OIDC role the Lambdas already use.
The trade-off is that Amplify's console shows manual deployments with no commit
metadata — the commit that produced a build is in the Actions run, not Amplify.

`VITE_*` values are baked into the bundle at build time from repo *variables*
(not secrets — they ship to every browser that loads the app). Changing the API
URL or pool means updating the variable **and** re-running the deploy; editing
Amplify's own environment variables does nothing, because Amplify never builds.

## Smoke test

1. Open <https://admin.ti-smarthealth.com> → redirected to the Cognito
   hosted UI → sign in (password change on first use).
2. Database page: pick `genders` → 4 rows, read-only.
3. Translations page: needs the PAT above; until then it errors.

Verified at provisioning time, without signing in:

- `GET /tables` direct Lambda invoke → 200, real row counts from `season1`.
- `GET /tables` through the gateway, no token → **401**; with a malformed token → **401**.
- `OPTIONS /tables` → 200 with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` set to the Amplify URL.
- The deployed SPA redirects to the hosted UI with the right `client_id`,
  `redirect_uri` and PKCE (`code_challenge_method=S256`), no console errors.
- Deep link `/database` → 200 (SPA rewrite rule works).
- Approval gate against the deployed Lambda: claims without `approved` → **403
  NOT_APPROVED with no database query issued**; `cognito:groups=[approved]` → 200 with data.
- Sign-up form at `/signup` with a `@gmail.com` address → the trigger's own
  message rendered in the form, **and no user created in the pool**.

**Not yet verified: that a verification email actually arrives.** Cognito
accepted the SES configuration (it validates the identity and the sending
policy when `DEVELOPER` is set), and the domain is verified with DKIM passing —
but no mail has been sent through the path end to end, because doing so means
creating a real account. The first staff sign-up is the test. If no code
arrives, look at SES Seoul's sending metrics and the pool's CloudWatch logs
before suspecting the client.

## Known gaps

Recorded, not fixed — these belong to the security plan rather than this setup:

- `DB_PASSWORD` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are plaintext Lambda env vars, readable by
  anyone with `lambda:GetFunctionConfiguration`. Secrets Manager is the fix.
  Same finding as D2 in `MIGRATION.md`, which the app backend also has. The
  two-function split does narrow the blast radius — each holds only its own
  credential — but does not solve it.
- The Lambda connects as `mcha291`, the RDS master user, but only ever SELECTs.
  A read-only Postgres role would be least privilege.
- `pg` connects with `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`, so the database
  connection is encrypted but unauthenticated.
- The `github-lambda-deploy` trust policy matches every repo in the
  `ti-smarthealth` org, any ref (`repo:ti-smarthealth/*` plus its ID-suffixed
  twin — see `DEPLOY.md` for why there are two patterns). Ported
  behaviour-for-behaviour from the personal account's `repo:mcha291/*` when the
  repo transferred, 2026-08-25. Narrowing to specific repos and
  `refs/heads/main` remains the open least-privilege item.
