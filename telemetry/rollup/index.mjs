/**
 * TELEMETRY.md §4 — the nightly aggregation that puts Athena-derived numbers
 * somewhere a dashboard can read them instantly.
 *
 * **Two handlers in one file, split across the VPC boundary, exactly as
 * `escalate.mjs` is** — and for the same unavoidable reason. This account has
 * **no NAT gateway and no VPC endpoints**, so:
 *
 * - a VPC-attached function can reach RDS and *nothing else* — no Athena, no
 *   S3, no AWS API at all, because a Lambda ENI never gets a public IP;
 * - a non-VPC function can reach every AWS API and *not* RDS, which is private.
 *
 * The rollup needs both. So the Athena half drives and invokes the database
 * half through the Lambda API, which is the direction that works: a non-VPC
 * function can call Lambda freely, whereas the reverse would need an interface
 * endpoint (~$7/month/AZ) to do what one extra invoke does for nothing.
 *
 *   EventBridge → tish-telemetry-rollup (non-VPC, Athena)
 *                     └─ invoke → tish-telemetry-rollup-db (VPC, Postgres)
 *
 * **Why nightly and not on page load**, restated because "just query Athena
 * from the portal" is the obvious shortcut and §4 rejects it on three separate
 * grounds: API Gateway REST times out at 29 seconds while Athena is
 * asynchronous and polled; every Athena query bills a 10 MB minimum, so N
 * charts × every viewer × every refresh is a real line item; and Firehose
 * buffers for five minutes, so the data is already stale and "live" buys
 * nothing. One query a night, a handful of rows, read through the API the
 * portal already has.
